I wanted to make a simple api and found this article: [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-amazon-api-gateway-as-a-proxy-for-dynamodb/](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-amazon-api-gateway-as-a-proxy-for-dynamodb/) which was great but not so easy to follow along. After hours of trying to get it to work it finally did, and was really easy.

This just goes over how to do it as a rough demo, I did not secure the url or use my own url, and I'm sure there are things that could be done better/ more properly.
