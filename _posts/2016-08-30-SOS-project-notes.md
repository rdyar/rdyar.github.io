Just some random notes from a project - the Simple Ordering System.

## Windows Command Line Stuff

Command prompt - not PowerShell to see a list of Environment Variables: type `set`. Only works in the command prompt window, not PS.

Powershell: set an environment variable: `$env:API_URL = "http://localhost:3100/api"`
To read it back: `echo $env:API_URL`
