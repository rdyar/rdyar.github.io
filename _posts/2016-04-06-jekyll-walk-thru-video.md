I made a video showing how I use [Jekyll](http://http://jekyllrb.com/) to build our website for our lab - [ProLabPrints.com](https://prolabprints.com). 
It came out a *little* long at 35 minutes, I was hoping for something a little more watchable around 15 minutes but that didn't happen.

It isn't meant to be a tutorial, just a way to show some of the ways we use liquid, includes, layouts and what not. I would have loved to see a few
videos like this when I was learning Jekyll - even now I would still love to see how other people do things.
